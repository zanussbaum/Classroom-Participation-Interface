        This interface allows for professors to ask questions to students during classtime. The students 
            responses are saved and allow the professor to gauge how well their lectures are being received.
            This can act as a substitute to a Google-Form, as it offers more flexibility since questions
            can be posed on the spot. Additionally, a professor has the ability to look at past responses
            from previous classes, if desired.
