Through explorations of how African women have used their diverse experiences to produce knowledge and challenge oppressive systems both in African and the world, writ-large, this course focuses on anti-colonial discourse, development, grassroots activism, and intellectual scholarship that advocates for gender equity and the liberation and autonomy of African people. Some of the core questions that guide this class are: what are African feminisms? What conditions created the need for different types of gendered responses from African women? How are the varied feminisms across Africa uniquely different from oneanother and fromfeminisms elaborated based on Western women?\nThrough readings that centralize the scholarship of African feminists, we explore topics such as race, gender, and sexuality, class politics, the tensions of rural-urban/ traditional-modern dichotomies in Africa, transnational feminisms, reproductive justice, sexual violence, homophobia, heteronormativity, and the historicity and cultural specificity of the subordinationsthat African women adopt, negotiate, and/or resist.We will examine these concerns through a critical reading of a wide range of texts-from memoir, policy case studies, ethnography, novels, essays, and cultural criticism and sociopolitical analyses.\nSatisfies Africana Sttudies major Social Thought and Institutions track requirement.\nSatisfies Gender and Sexuality Studies minor requirement.\nSatisfies Social-Scientific Thought Ways of Knowing requirement.\nSatisfies Justice, Equality and Community requirement.Prerequisites\n","Sec":"0","Time":"0130 - 0420pm","Lvl":"331","Instructor":"Harper-Shipman T             Bowles L","CRN":"10519","Room":"2130"}

In particular, the Internet is a massive deployment of network algorithms and systems, with lasting social, scientific, and economical impact. Network algorithms and systems are specified by protocols, which allow different organizations to interoperate. Protocols are designed to handle network failures and non-cooperative agents, and to operate at large scale without critical performance issues. Algorithms and systems associated with network protocols are elegant and significant applications of fundamental Computer Science ideas. This course studies fundamental Internet protocols such as ARP, IP, ICM, and TCP; higher-level application protocols, such as DNS, HTTP, SMTP, and security-related protocols; as well as medium access control specifications for Ethernet and wireless networks. All of these protocols are studied from a perspective that emphasizes their algorithmic and design-related aspects, with focus on the fundamental computer science principles underlying the associated algorithms and systems.\nFulfills the Systems area requirement of the Computer Science major.\nSatisfies a requirement in the Computer Science minor.PrerequisitesCSC 221 (Data Structures) and CSC 250 (Computer Organization)\n","Sec":"0","Time":"0230 - 0345pm","Lvl":"359","Instructor":"Mendes H","CRN":"10002","Room":"132"}

Sharing a common history involving French colonial rule, the Francophone Caribbean comprises primarily of the French Dpartements d'outre mer (DOMs) of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana, and the Republic of Haiti, which has been independent since 1804. However, these territories also diverge economically, culturally, and in terms of their political status. This course introduces students to the Francophone Caribbean's complex history as well as its fascinating and dynamic culture in novels by Jacques Roumain, Marie Vieux Chauvet, Dany Laferrire, and Maryse Cond, poems by Aim Csaire, and films by Raoul Peck and Euzhan Palcy. We also extend our exploration in the Francophone Caribbean world to other artistic expressions, such as paintings by Edouard Duval-Carri and Franktienne. In examining these cultural productions, we analyze representations of race, class, identity, gender, sexuality, politics, and exile. We additionally learn about crucial theoretical movements that have shaped the Francophone Caribbean intellectual thought, which begins with Csaire's Ngritude, moves through Glissant's Antillanit, and leads to Crolit.PrerequisitesThis course is taught in French and is open to advanced undergraduate students.\n","Sec":"0","Time":"1230 - 0120pm","Lvl":"331","Instructor":"Mohammed S","CRN":"10543","Room":"109"}

And why has it become an immensely popular site for the representation of illness, disability, and medicine? In this Introduction to Literature class, we'll start with the premise that the unique intersection of word, color, image, text, and juxtaposition offered by the graphic novel offers authors singular opportunities for storytelling. We will further ask: what do comics, zines, and graphic novels have to teach us about our varied kinds of embodiment, particularly about disabled bodies? We will consider how these visual textsteach us about how bodies engage with the social and medical contexts surrounding them. Encompassing everything from bipolar disorder to cancer, depression to HIV/AIDS, epilepsy to deafness, and end-of-life issues to amputation, possible course works may include Epileptic, Cancer Vixen, Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?, and Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michaelangelo, and Me.

Some are influential classics, such as Beowulf, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Some are recent works by prominent writers, such as Octavia Butler's Fledgling, Colson Whitehead's Zone One, and short fiction by Margaret Atwood and Karen Russell. Some are bestsellers, such as Stephen King's The Outsider; films, such as Nosferatu and Night of the Living Dead; and television shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Penny Dreadful. One is a graphic novel with a topic and a title to suit this course, Emil Ferris's My Favorite Thing Is Monsters. \nEach text will be contextualized, so that students will discuss each monster as a response to distinct fears. Students will also discuss the unstable place of monsters in cultural history, so essential to ancient and medieval texts at the core of the canon, yet later associated with popular entertainment. Like all who survive encounters with monsters, the students of this section will come away with new questions and new ways of reading.\n\nENG 110 Shakespeare &amp; Sports\nInstructor\nLewis\nContemporary sports and Elizabethan theater have much in common. Both present spectacles, before a rowdy audience, in an arena. Both involve rehersal and scripted performance. Both require guides, whether a director or a coach. Both create rivalry, whether between teams or acting companies. Most important, both center on stories that thrive on the essential, exhilarating, and painful human experience. Like Shakespeare's plays, sports history yields instances of extraordinary heroism and of heart-breaking mistakes. Realathletes find reflection in many of Shakespeare's best known characters. Take, for instance, Dale Earrnhardt, Jr., whose larger-than-lifefather haunts him as King Hamlet's ghost haunts his son. Andre Agassi's second chance at tennis recalls The Tempest's Prospero, who is exiled from and returns to dominate another court. This class explores how such moments and people in sports find reflection in Shakespeare's works.\n\nENG110 - Introduction to Comedy\nInstructor\nIngram\nThis course offers an overview of the comic tradition in English, from the Middle Ages to the present, from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales to Arrested Development. Although humor will be a recurring feature of some texts and of most class meetings, this course traces how comedies respond to inescapable challenges of human life: social and political structures as apparent obstacles to the desires of individuals; the body and its failings, to the point of death; art, particularly comedy, as a reassuring (or maybe deceptive) refuge of happy endings that can seem elusive in life. Different eras respond differently to those challenges, so the course offers a broad survey of literary and cultural history. Over the semester, students and professor alike will look for comedy in surprising places, including in the form of the course itself, certain to end happily, before it has even begun.\n\nENG 110 - Media &amp; Community\nInstructor\nChurchill\n\nFrom Walt Whitman's broad embrace of American readers in the 1860s to the digital social networks of today, this course examines how various media form communities of readers and writers. We will investigate how lyric poetry creates one kind of intimacy between author and reader, how blogs establish another, and how the NBC television comedy Community builds its own cult following. Davidson College meets Greendale Community College in a course that teaches you how to read, analyze, and respond critically and creatively to various forms of media.\nMedia &amp; Community topic satisfies a requirement of the Digital Studies interdisciplinary minor.\n\nENG 110 Growing Up in America\nInstructor\nS.

Whether we are using sign language or watching the unfolding of a graceful dvelopp in ballet, we are tuned in to the ways in which our gestures communicate meaning. The study of gesture is a multidisciplinary effort, as scholars draw on fields as diverse as psychoanalysis, performance studies, dance, neuroscience, anthropology, linguistics, behavioral science, and literary analysis. This course will examine the interpenetrations of gesture with both speech and thought in a series of cultural artifacts, ranging from the silent film comedy of Buster Keaton in The General (1926) and the fiction of Nathanael West and Zadie Smith, to the YouTube videos of Chris Crocker (\"Leave Britney Alone!\") and the documentaries Paris is Burning (1990) and Rize (2005). What does it mean to study gesture in an interdisciplinary way? What questions do theorists of gesture ask of the literary and cultural artifacts they study? How do gestures amplify our understanding of each other and of literary characters and documentary subjects? Rooted in close reading and analysis, this class will ask students to consider how our movements create meaning and what those meanings suggest about our culture(s) and the other cultures under consideration in the course.\n\n\nSatisfies a Liberal Studies requirement.Prerequisites\n","Sec":"0","Time":"1215 - 0130pm","Lvl":"116","Instructor":"Fackler M","CRN":"10426","Room":"3106"}

We will reconsider disability history, question socially defined categories of normalcy and ability, and learn about the presence of disability culture. Rather than trying to catalogue all the examples of disability in literature, this course seeks to use disability studies as a genesis point and theoretical framework through which to examine several core questions about disability, literature, and the problems and opportunities arising from the intersection of the two. We will reconsider representations of disability in literature; examine how disability is a culturally constructed category like race, gender, class, and sexuality (and how it intersects with those); study contemporary writing, performance, and art from disability culture; and consider how disability aesthetics can meaningfully contribute to the processes and products of artistic creation.

But what, according to Smith, were the limits of reason and rationality? What were Keynes's views on 'animal spirits', the spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical speculation, that drove human action? How did Marx distinguish between fixed or constant drives that are integral to human nature and the relative appetites that are rooted in particular social structures and modes of production? How did Polanyi contrast rational self-interested behavior in the market society of early modern Western Europe with socially motivated behavior in the communitarian patterns of organization in traditional societies? The objective of this course is to conduct a close study of select \"great texts\" in economics, focusing on classics in economic thought supplemented with contemporary analyses.\n\nSection B: The Economics of Conservation Biology\nInstructor: Martin\nThis course focuses on the economic analysis of conservation biology policies, which are intended to preserve biodiversity. The goals of conservation biology and economic analyses can conflict because the former prioritizes preserving the status quo while the latter promotes creative destruction. Also, the complex ecological goals of a biodiversity policy must be implemented within an equally complex human society. Students will read, discuss, and write about the primary literature to learn about these tensions, their causes, and potential resolutions to them. At the end of the course, the students will bring all of this material together into an economic analysis of a biodiversity policy of their choice.\n\nSection C: The Geography of Prosperity\nInstructor: Smith\nWhy is North Korea's economic output per person a fraction of South Korea's? Why did theIndustrial Revolution begin in England? This course will examine competing theories behind why some societies have enjoyed economic success while others have not. Special attention will be paid to understanding the role of economic institutions and the role of geography in generating long run economic prosperity.\n\nSection D: The Economics of Foreign Direct Investment\nInstructor: Stroup\nMultinational firms with operations spanning national boundaries are some of the most powerful companies in the world. Why do some firms go global? What prevents others from internationalizing their operations? How do multinationals innovate? Do they benefit the countries where they operate? Answers to these questions will help us understand the world we live in, and we will use economics to examine these and other issues to learn how firms respond to the pressures of globalization and how the global presence of these firms affects our well-being.\n\nSection H: Honors Thesis\nInstructor: Foley\nCompletion of the honors research proposed in Economics 494 (section H), including estimation of the empirical models, interpretation and discussion of the results, and a concluding section.

We investigate links between innovation and globalization such as those between the transportation revolution and the first era of globalization (La Belle poque), and the information technology revolution and the current era. The many narratives of positive and normative attributes of globalization that exist (it increases inequality, it reduces poverty, it increases competition, it concentrates economic power, it is aspirational, it is predatory) all acknowledge its transformative power. We assess competing perspectives by reviewing the evidence on the integration of goods and capital markets, fragmentation of production systems, wage inequality and global price markups among other things. In the context of the intellectual discourse on the relationship between markets, institutions, society and human nature, we inquire into the sources of populism such as inequality aversion that challenge globalization today.\nSection B: TBD\nInstructor:Gouri Suresh\n\nSPRING 2020SENIOR SEMINARS\nSection A: US Income Inequality\nInstructor: Ross\nSection B: Eco Foreign Direct Investment\nInstructor: Stroup\nSection C: \"Great\" Books in Economics\nInstructor: Jha\nThis course will survey the great thinkers, their seminal ideas, and the great texts of economic thought in the history of the discipline.

Also, the complex ecological goals of a biodiversity policy must be implemented within an equally complex human society. Students will read, discuss, and write about the primary literature to learn about these tensions, their causes, and potential resolutions to them. At the end of the course, the students will bring all of this material together into an economic analysis of a biodiversity policy of their choice.\n\nSection C: The Geography of Prosperity\nInstructor: Smith\nWhy is North Korea's economic output per person a fraction of South Korea's? Why did theIndustrial Revolution begin in England? This course will examine competing theories behind why some societies have enjoyed economic success while others have not. Special attention will be paid to understanding the role of economic institutions and the role of geography in generating long run economic prosperity.\n\nSection D: The Economics of Foreign Direct Investment\nInstructor: Stroup\nMultinational firms with operations spanning national boundaries are some of the most powerful companies in the world. Why do some firms go global? What prevents others from internationalizing their operations? How do multinationals innovate? Do they benefit the countries where they operate? Answers to these questions will help us understand the world we live in, and we will use economics to examine these and other issues to learn how firms respond to the pressures of globalization and how the global presence of these firms affects our well-being.\n\nSection H: Honors Thesis\nInstructor: Foley\nCompletion of the honors research proposed in Economics 494 (section H), including estimation of the empirical models, interpretation and discussion of the results, and a concluding section. Oral defense of the thesis is required. Students will also take comprehensive exams in microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, ETS Major Field Test in Economics and an oral examination conducted by an external examiner\nPrerequisite: Pass in Economics 494 and permission of the Department Chair. (Spring)\n\nFALL 2019SENIOR SEMINARS\nSection A:Globalization: History and Current Challenges\nInstructor: Kumar\nThis course examines current challenges to globalization framed by a study of the historical experience of international integration, the regimes that regulated the process, and the frictions that halted it. We investigate links between innovation and globalization such as those between the transportation revolution and the first era of globalization (La Belle poque), and the information technology revolution and the current era. The many narratives of positive and normative attributes of globalization that exist (it increases inequality, it reduces poverty, it increases competition, it concentrates economic power, it is aspirational, it is predatory) all acknowledge its transformative power. We assess competing perspectives by reviewing the evidence on the integration of goods and capital markets, fragmentation of production systems, wage inequality and global price markups among other things. In the context of the intellectual discourse on the relationship between markets, institutions, society and human nature, we inquire into the sources of populism such as inequality aversion that challenge globalization today.\nSection B: TBD\nInstructor:Gouri Suresh\n\nSPRING 2020SENIOR SEMINARS\nSection A: US Income Inequality\nInstructor: Ross\nSection B: Eco Foreign Direct Investment\nInstructor: Stroup\nSection C: \"Great\" Books in Economics\nInstructor: Jha\nThis course will survey the great thinkers, their seminal ideas, and the great texts of economic thought in the history of the discipline. Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\" changed the world, with a basic trinity of individual prerogatives: self-interest division of labor, and freedom of trade. But what, according to Smith, were the limits of reason and rationality? What were Keynes's views on 'animal spirits', the spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical speculation, that drove human action? How did Marx distinguish between fixed or constant drives that are integral to human nature and the relative appetites that are rooted in particular social structures and modes of production? How did Polanyi contrast rational self-interested behavior in the market society of early modern Western Europe with socially motivated behavior in the communitarian patterns of organization in traditional societies? The objective of this course is to conduct a close study of select \"great texts\" in economics, focusing on classics in economic thought supplemented with contemporary analyses.Prerequisites\n","Sec":"B","Time":"0230 - 0345pm","Lvl":"495","Instructor":"Gouri Suresh S","CRN":"10099","Room":"3155"}

The troupe and those associated with it changed over the course of its twenty-year existence (1909 -1929), but during that period they always remained under the scrutiny of its founding impresario, Diaghilev. A master curator, Diaghilev brought together some of the most interesting artists, composers, dancers, choreographers, fashion designers, and personalities of the era, which resulted in a maelstrom of creative and collaborative output, the impact of which still resonates in the present day across artistic mediums. From the scandals to the massive successes, this course examines some highlights of the Ballets Russes, looking at visionary choreographers, such as Fokine, Nijinsky, Nijinska, and Balanchine, world-renowned visual artists, like Picasso, Matisse, and Braque, genre-breaking composers, such as Debussy, Prokofiev, and Stravinsky, and even a few guest appearances by Jean Cocteau and Coco Chanel. We also will consider the role of \"Russianness\" in Diaghilev's project and how it changed over the course of the group's history as Russia itself changed in tandem with the ever-changing political landscape of Europe in the early twentieth century. Finally, what is the Ballets Russes' legacy? How has this group of artists creating and performing in the first decades of the twentieth century influenced the arts and culture into the present day? Our discussions will focus on topics such as theoretical approaches to media; the ways in which the Ballets Russes engaged with movements such as constructivism, cubism, futurism, impressionism, expressionism, neoclassicism, primitivism, surrealism, and symbolism; the role of nationality and nationhood in the self-exoticizing trends of the early Ballets Russes works versus later ones; othering and the role of gender and race in the Ballets Russes' mythos.

But much U.S. queer and feminist thought and activism has taken root outside the bounds of liberal electoral politics. This course centers on the fringes. It surveys the writings of less-palatable political actors: punks, anarchists, communists, anti-capitalists, sex workers, black radicals, and prison abolitionists. In exploring these political genealogies, we will ask: How does the personal constitute the political? What counts as (legitimate) political action according to whom? (How) can social change be effected outside of electoral politics and state institutions? What should be the role of the state in regulating labor and distributing rights and entitlements? What priorities have animated the various radical traditions within queer and feminist thought, and how have they addressed or failed to address race, class, ethnicity, and disability? How have these traditions intersected and diverged? Why have contemporary queer radicals come to focus on issues less obviously connected to gender and sexuality like global capitalism, drone warfare, and police militarization?\n\nSatisfies a requirement for the Gender and Sexuality Studies major and minor.

We draw on case studies to deconstruct family in the US, South Africa, and China. We consider shifts in opinions surrounding marriage and marriage equality and how the movement for same-sex marriage has changed these attitudes. We focus on trans families and (re)producing trans families through the case of cisgender women and transgender men. We focus on the potential of polyamory and polyqueer sexualities in breaking down sexist and racist assumptions about relationships. We examine intersectionality across different cases, with a particular focus on Black lesbian mothers, queer Latinas, and queer families in Taiwan.

A student walks to the Commons because lunch is there. A politician gives a speech in order to win voters. Galileo looks through his telescope as a way to learn about the cosmos. But it has proven remarkably difficult to fit such commonsense facts about human behavior into the world presented to us by the natural sciences. There are three main sources of the problem. (1) Mechanism: It seems increasingly likely that neuroscience will eventually provide an entirely mechanistic explanation for everything we do. But then what work is left for reasons in the explanation of behavior? (2) Externalism: Reasons for action are external to us, yet it seems that all causation is \"local\": anything that causes us to act must be internal to our brains and bodies. (3) Normativity: When we act for reasons, we do so because that's the good or rational thing to do, at least by our own lights. But there seems to be no place to fit such normativity into the natural world. After grappling with these three problems, we turn to Fred Dretske's book, Explaining Behavior (MIT Press, 1988). This is our core text for the course. We will look in detail at Dretske's theory of action and how he proposes to find reasons in a world of causes.\nFall 2018 - Anarchismand the State\nInstructor: Studtmann\nWhat justifies the State? Would societies be better off without it? What would a society without a State look like? If the State is inevitable, what would a just state look like? These questions have been at the heart of a great deal of political theorizing in the twentieth century. In this course, we will examine these questions by reading the work of several prominent philosophers.PrerequisitesThis course can be repeated for credit given sufficiently distinct topics:check with the department chair.

Scholars of the Native South critique the \"black and white\" master narrative of Southern history and suggest that an inclusive perspective with Native people at its heart enriches the stories we tell about this region. We seek to understand how Native people in this region formed, maintained, and evolved as distinct groups united (and sometimes divided) by experience, belief, and action.

We consider historical debates about the origins of the Revolution, and investigate the symbols and rituals of revolutionary culture. What were the consequences of the revolutionary moment for groups not included in triumphal rhetoric of liberty, equality and fraternity (women, workers, enslaved and free black people)? And how has the Revolution been remembered and commemorated around the world in the two centuries since the Bastille fell?Prerequisites\n","Sec":"0","Time":"0140 - 0420pm","Lvl":"424","Instructor":"Tilburg P","CRN":"10403","Room":"2196"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [Q] Democracy's Bodies\nT R 9:40 - 10:55\nFox\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom. By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"A","Time":"1230 - 0120pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Foley W","CRN":"10271","Room":"1045"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"B","Time":"0930 - 1020am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Roberts S","CRN":"10272","Room":"1096"}

We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [Q] Democracy's Bodies\nT R 9:40 - 10:55\nFox\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom. By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"C","Time":"1215 - 0130pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Rippeon A","CRN":"10274","Room":"1045"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health.

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"E","Time":"1130 - 1220pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Plank K","CRN":"10276","Room":"1045"}

By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [Q] Democracy's Bodies\nT R 9:40 - 10:55\nFox\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom. By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"F","Time":"0930 - 1020am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Blum J","CRN":"10277","Room":"1045"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking?

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent?

Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"I","Time":"0940 - 1055am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Campbell A","CRN":"10283","Room":"307"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"J","Time":"0230 - 0320pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Ingram R","CRN":"10293","Room":"B027"}

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources.

We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"L","Time":"0805 - 0920am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Stutts L","CRN":"10285","Room":"1045"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking?

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent?

While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [Q] Democracy's Bodies\nT R 9:40 - 10:55\nFox\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom. By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"O","Time":"0930 - 1020am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Churchill S","CRN":"10291","Room":"1015"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking?

We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [Q] Democracy's Bodies\nT R 9:40 - 10:55\nFox\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom. By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations?

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"R","Time":"0940 - 1055am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Hillard V","CRN":"10295","Room":"1046"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"S","Time":"0305 - 0420pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Horowitz K","CRN":"10096","Room":"1062"}

In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father). As a final project, each student will write an episode of family narrative (7-8 pages) with commentary (2-3pages) relating the narrative to two other works read in the course. We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it. In thiscourse, we'll explore virtual and real spaces ranging from websites and home pages, to homes, hospitals, and prisons. We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002).

We will focus less on how much we write than how well.\nTexts for the course include: Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Mary Karr, The Liars' Club; Li-Young Lee, The Winged Seed; Tracy Smith, Ordinary Light; and Tobias Wolff, This Boy'sLife.\nWRITING 101 [F]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society. The role of religion in this ideal has always been a contentious topic, and in recent years it has reemerged as a matter of dispute. This class poses the question: what role should religion play in public discourse? The class will draw on a variety of perspectives that speak to fundamental questions about the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities that citizens have, and the role that religion plays in those challenging questions. Students will write three major papers, in addition to a number of smaller, lower-stakes writing assignments.\nWRITING 101 [G]Religion in the Public Square\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nBlum\nThe ideal of democracy is a society in which well-informed citizens who disagree with each other engage in free and reasoned debate, guided by the shared aim of cultivating a flourishing society.

Students will become a local expert on one \"controversial\" topic and write about this topic using data to formulate logical arguments. Students will be guided in methods for drafting and revising their work which will be critiqued by classmates.Course work includes multiple brief, low-stakes written assignments, as well as consistent engagement with course readings through regular participation in class discussion. Six minor and one major written projects are required, each of which involves detailed analysis of texts, while also challenging students to articulate and defend their own positions based on data.\nWRITING 101 [J] Writing Criticism\nM W F 2:30 - 3:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship. This section thus pushes beyond simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments; it focuses on criticism as writing that deepens our understandings of cultural texts-literature, theater, film, and more. Campus events will provide a number of our cultural texts, including books by visiting writers and plays on Davidson's stages. We will write about these texts, and we will respond to one another's writing, those responses being an essential form of criticism for this section of WRI 101. By the end of the semester, students will be more attentive readers of a range of cultural texts, including their own prose.\nWRITING 101 [K] Justice and Piety\nM W F 8:30 - 9:20\nShaw\nThe course offers students a chance to investigate an age-old and central question of political life: what is the relation of political justice and religious faith? While most of us in 21 st century liberal democracies assume that politics and religion have nothing in common-or at least, ought to remain entirely separate-political philosophers have long acknowledged their intimate and mutually implicative relationship.\nWe'll explore this relationship by reading closely and discussing extensively writings that span several genres (epic poetry, historical narrative, rhetoric and dramatic dialogue) by four Greek authors: Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plato. We'll attempt this task as well by writing often and in a variety of formats. In all assignments students will be encouraged to articulate and defend their own interpretations and points of view.\nWRITING 101 [L] In Stitches\nM W 8:05- 9:20\nStutts\nPsychological functioning has a profound effect on one's health. In recent decades, research has focused on the contribution of positive emotions on overall wellbeing. This course will explore the intersection of positive psychology and healthcare by answering this broad question: How do positive psychological variables affect health? We will investigate this question through the discussion of empirical articles, memoirs, case studies, and videos. In addition, there are five major writing projects: 1) personal reflection on how positive variables influenced your health or someone's health in your life, 2) text analysis of how positive psychology concepts map onto a patient memoir, 3) argument paper about how the mind affects the body, 4) research paper on a specific positive psychology and health topic of your choice, and 5) synthesis paper of the major themes across the course and an extension into what the field should prioritize in the future to optimize functioning.\nWRITING 101 [M] From Papyrus to Print to iPad: The History of Scripture\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nSnyder\nWhere does \"scripture\" come from? How does it grow and change over time? How does its form-handwritten, then printed, and now digital-affect its meaning? These questions lie at the heart of the course, and we'll explore them by looking at the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. Along the way, we'll create our own handwritten manuscript with reed pens and papyrus; we'll set type and print our own documents in the letterpress shop in order to understand the printing revolution, and work with artifacts in the Rare Book Room. Finally, we'll consider what happens when scriptures are digitized and move into \"the cloud.\" How do the new digital forms of scripture influence its interpretation and authority?\nThe course features four writing projects, each of which passes through distinct stages that will prepare you for every paper you'll write in college: finding and assimilating reliable sources, citing them; capturing your ideas, drafting, revising, and revising again. Along the way, we'll form a collaborative community of writers and editors, learning how to comment helpfully on the work of others and to benefit from the comments of our fellow writers.\nWRITING 101 [N] The American West\nM W F 10:30 - 11:20\nGarcia Peacock\nWhat is the American West? Where is the American West? And, why does discussion of the ways in which its diverse people, places, and spaces have changed over time ignite passionate debate among historians and the public alike? In this writing seminar, we will pursue answers to these questions through an examination of the key ideas and images that have shaped our view of this region since the nineteenth century. A series of writing projects will help students gain broader and more nuanced understandings of the West through a pursuit of three key themes: race, environment, and representation. Each of these writing projects will take the form of a multi-week sequence of activities aimed at encouraging critical and close engagement with a wide range of texts, including: journalistic writing, creative non-fiction, scholarly articles, historical monographs, and visual material such as painting, photography, public art, and the landscape itself. By the end of the course, students will emerge with a portfolio of several essays that should, as set, offer a unique perspective on how and why the American West remains a relevant topic and site of debate in early twenty-first century.\nWRITING 101 [O] Building Stories\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nChurchill\nArchitecture is not a passive structure we occupy; it shapes our minds and imaginations, influencing what we do and how we do it.

We'll also approach writing as a form of building, breaking out of the boring 5-paragraph essay blueprint into order reimagine essays as enticing dwelling spaces for readers. In this course, you must think of yourself not just as a writer of college papers, but as an architect, designer, and builder of multimedia essays. Thecourse itselfinhabits the digital realm: you'll publish your essays on a course website and design a website of your own, which you can use to showcase your work throughout your career.No previous technological training needed, but creativity, critical thinking, and a collaborative spirit are required.\nWRITING 101 [P]Writing Criticism\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nIngram\nThis section of WRI 101 considers criticism broadly, from online reviews to professional scholarship.

By learning of the nation's founding, participating in communal activities, and observing politics in action, citizens absorb these omnipresent values starting in childhood, when aspirations about the shape of civic life begin to be formed. One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [R] Democracy's Bodies\nT H 9:40-10:55\nHillard\nDemocracy in the United States refers to a form of representative government that invokes powerful values such as fairness, equality, and freedom.

We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"U","Time":"0130 - 0220pm","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Studtmann P","CRN":"10298","Room":"2084"}

The subjects for writing in the course vary by instructors.\nFall 2019Sections\nWRITING 101 [A] White Surpremacy and Racism\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nW Foley\nThe core questions that guide this course and its written assignments are \"How have enslaved and oppressed people of color in the United States most poignantly and incisively expressed their experience of white supremacy?\" and \"How, in turn, have white people most effectively and cunningly legitimated-at least in their own minds-their supremacy and its concomitant racism?\" Students will be asked to post several short, low-stakes, unrevised writing assignments on Moodle as well as to complete four major projects, each drafted, responded to in either workshop or conference, and revised.\nWRITING 101 [B] The American Dream\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nRoberts\nThe central question this seminar asks is: Why does the concept of the American Dream work as a touchstone of our American society and politics? In this seminar, we will unpack what political scientist Cal Jilson has called \"one of the most evocative phrases in our national lexicon,\" namely the American Dream. We will examine its origins and endurance in American democracy. Ubiquitous in political rhetoric, this concept of the American Dream has animated our views on race, class, education, housing, immigration, income inequality, and upward mobility. Through analyzing philosophies of the Founders, legislation, and political discourse, we will come to understand how this concept has been embedded and extended in our national psyche. The course will involve a number of low-stakes, shorter response papers, three papers, and one research project.\nWRITING 101 [C]Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT R 12:15- 1:30\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"? It can be something we own (as in a limited-edition print); it can be something we do (as in print by hand, print by laser-jet, or print on demand); and, it can describe entire modalities of reception (as in print-journalism or a print-book). We're surrounded by information; much of it is textual, but it no longer makes sense, as perhaps it once did, to assume that the primary vehicle of text is print. This writing class examines the contested (some might say \"endangered\") status of print in the 21st century. What questions arise when we consider form in relation to content? How do communities of readers emerge, and how are they supported by different forms of textuality? We will explore questions of ownership, access, and use, and we'll situate our critical writing in relation to our own practices and habits as readers and writers-consumers and producers-of text in various modalities. Our investigations will cover a wide array of materials and experiences: we will\nexamine holdings in the College's Special Collections; we'll engage with popular journalism and cultural criticism concerning \"the death\" (and possible re-birth) of print; we'll consider a few literary examples; and we'll practice technologies of print-materiality.\nWRITING 101 [D] Print:Noun...Verb...Adjective?\nT H 1:40 - 2:55\nRippeon\nHow do we orient ourselves to the multivalent term \"print\"?

In doing so, it will ask throughout about the process of recollecting a life and writing about it, how the story we tell of ourselves is also a story of others, especially those we know as kin; and, it will probe these stories for what they tell us about the impact of gender, race, class, generation, and ethnicity in the shaping of family experience. These are big questions. We get at them by the smaller tasks of reading good texts well day after day and writing clearly about them. The smaller tasks add up and may be the greater endeavor after all.\nThe writing assignments include a number of short essays (in the vicinity of 5-6) that may range from a paragraph to 4-5 pages. These may involve matters of style (the power of a well-chosen word, a paragraph that does what a paragraph ought to), questions of interpretation (explanation, analysis), or thematic concerns (back to that family and why everyone is talking about his or her father).

One might say that since a young age, we are effectively saturated with democracy's ideologically-directed promises and predispositions. Among many other influences, democracy exerts its force on the body itself. The ideal democratic citizen is often conjured up as having certain idealized characteristics related to its physicality, its ability, its integrity, and its social behaviors. Beginning with a close and critical reading of the Declaration of Independence and a brief study of its genesis, and extending to several narratives of how the \"democratic body\" is both embraced and rejected, and ending with considerations of how the democratic body speaks and listens in a variety of public settings, the course explores the question: How have U.S. citizens variously embodied democratic ideals, and what are the strengths and limits of those manifestations? The course requires students to carry out four major writing projects, each drafted and revised.\nWRITING 101 [S] #MeToo: Speaking Sexual Violence\nT H 3:05-4:20\nHorowitz\nThis course examines the rhetoric of #MeToo, the most recent iteration of the movement against gender-based violence, in the context of earlier representations of sexual harassment and assault. We will begin by studying recent historical flashpoints in the national dialogue about sexual abuse, including the Anita Hill hearings (1991); David Mamet's controversial play Oleanna (1992); President Bill Clinton's impeachment (1998); the Boston Globe's expos on the Catholic Church (2002). Approaching #MeToo as a genre of storytelling still taking shape, we will uncover emerging tropes and patterns in the narration of experiences of sexual abuse, in media portrayals thereof, and in the critical backlash. Based on our investigations, we will attempt to answer the questions, \"Whose and what kinds of stories of sexual violence are likeliest to capture a national audience? Whose and what kinds are likeliest to be silenced or ignored, and why?\" Our rhetorical analyses will follow the method advanced in David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen's Writing Analytically. The first assignment asks students to analyze the organizing themes and contrasts of a popularly circulated #MeToo story of their choosing. In the second, we will uncover assumptions about who and what constitutes an \"ideal victim\" in our class readings. The third assignment asks students to use a theoretical text on narratives of sexual abuse as a lens through which to interpret characters' actions and motivations in a fictional work on the topic. For their final project, students will perform close textual analyses of interviews with women faculty about their experiences of workplace sexual harassment and situate them with respect to the narrative priorities, possibilities, and limitations we have identified as shaping the broader movement.\nWRITING 101 [T] Buddhism and Violence\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nPang\nBuddhism evokes images of meditation, monks, and peace in the popular imagination. Indeed, \"non-harm\" (Skt. ahimsa) is one of the fundamental tenets of the religion. And yet, in recent decades, there has been a rise in cases of what the media has termed \"Buddhist\" forms of nationalism and violence. How can the members of a religion based on compassion for all sentient beings engage in ethnic intolerance, extreme nationalism and violence?\nIn this course, we will explore a variety of perspectives on this issue, including ethnographies, academic articles, writings by public intellectuals, and journal articles from the New York Times, the Economist, the Atlantic, and other news sources. In conjunction with developing an informed understanding of this issue, we will learn to craft robust and compelling arguments that will serve as the foundation of strong argumentative writing at the college level\nWRITING 101 [U] Sex, Love, and Friendship\nM W F 12:30 - 1:20\nStudtmann\nSex presents a number of moral and legal questions. Is it moral to have pre-marital sex? What is the difference between perverse sex and non-perverse sex? What is the appropriate legal stance toward various sexual activities, for instance prostitution, gay sex, and pre-marital sex. What are the moral and legal limits of consent? In this class, we read several contemporary philosophers who address these and other questions.\nWRITING 101 [V] Critical Reading and Critical Writing\nM W F 9:30 - 10:20\nGay\nDuring this semester, students and the course instructor will work as a team to answer one complex question: What is critical thinking? In this quest, we will read a series of non-fiction texts intended to develop critical reading skills and write a series of essays intended to develop critical writing skills.\nSpring 2020Sections\nComing Soon\nPrerequisites\n","Sec":"V","Time":"0930 - 1020am","Lvl":"101","Instructor":"Gay R","CRN":"10541","Room":"101"}
